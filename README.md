## Overview
In this competition, you had to create algorithms for "Knowledge Tracing," the modeling of student knowledge over time. The goal was to accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions (binary classification problem evaluated on AUC). In order to do so, the EdNet dataset was used; the worldâ€™s largest open database for AI education containing more than 100 million student interactions. The model applied is an ensemble of 4 LGBMs + 1 SAKT transformer.
